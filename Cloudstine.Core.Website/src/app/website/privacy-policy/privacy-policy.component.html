    <p class="text-muted" style="text-align: justify">
      To improve the responsiveness of the sites for our users, we may use
      "cookies", or similar electronic tools to collect information to assign
      each visitor a unique, random number as a User Identification (User ID) to
      understand the user's individual interests using the Identified Computer.
      Cookies are commonly-used software technology that allow us to customize
      our websites for you by placing small files on your computer or mobile
      device as you visit various components of our websites. The purpose of
      cookies is to make your experience more convenient and personal. For
      example, knowing what products interest you helps us tailor your
      experience to meet your needs. Cookies are the identifiers that a web
      server transfers to your computer via your Internet browser.<br /><br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When your Internet browser visits a web page, a cookie
      is set with a unique number. This number is recorded in a small text file

      your hard drive. Then, when you visit each webpage on which the cookie
      technology is enabled, the website can recognize your browser as a unique

      example), we will have no way of knowing who you are, even if we assign a
      cookie to your computer.<br /><br />

      click on their ads), a process that we do not control. Our web servers
      automatically collect limited information about your computer's connection

      where to send you data -- such as the web pages you view.) Your IP address
      does not identify you personally. We use this information to deliver our
      web pages to you upon request, to tailor our site to the interests of our
